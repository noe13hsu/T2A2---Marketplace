# SECOND HAND GAME STORE
## The problem
Have you ever traded your old games back to the major game stores, possibily the store you first bought the games from such as EB Games and JB Hi-Fi? I have, and I remember getting something like 1 dollar store credit for a game that I really enjoyed, and that is the problem this app is trying to solve, the low trade in value that you get back for games you paid 60 dollars or more for. This app aims to provide a selling/buying platform only for video games so you don't need to go to: 
* Gumtree: where games are in the same category with music and books
* Facebook Marketplace: where games are in the same category with toys

Hopefully, you can sell your old games for a higher price and buy second hand games for a cheaper price than you would have been offered by the major stores.

Here is the link to my [Second Hand Game Store](https://shgame.herokuapp.com/) and here is the link to the [GitHub](https://github.com/noe13hsu/T2A2---Marketplace) repo.
